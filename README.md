Luna is a versatile assistant built using a powerful combination of technologies, including Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and various specialized libraries. It offers a range of functionalities to enhance your interaction with technology.

## ‚ú® Features

Here's a glimpse of what Luna can do:

* **üß† Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Leverages the power of TensorFlow and scikit-learn for understanding and processing human language.
* **üåê Flask Web Interface:** Provides a user-friendly web interface built with Flask for seamless interaction.
* **üó£Ô∏è Speech Playback:** Utilizes `playsound` and `edge-tts` for clear and natural-sounding voice output.
* **üåç Translation Support:** Offers multilingual translation capabilities powered by `deep-translator`.
* **üéß Audio Input/Output:** Handles audio input and output using `PyAudio` and `pygame` for voice commands and sound processing.
* **üé¨ YouTube Downloading:** Enables you to download videos from YouTube using the efficient `yt-dlp` library.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

Follow these steps to get Luna up and running on your system:

### 1. Prerequisites

* **Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your machine.
    * Download the latest version from the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### 2. Install Dependencies

* **Navigate to the Project Directory:** Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you have saved the Luna project files.
* **Install Requirements:** Execute the following command to install all the necessary Python libraries:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(Make sure the `requirements.txt` file is present in the current directory.)*

### 3. Running Luna
